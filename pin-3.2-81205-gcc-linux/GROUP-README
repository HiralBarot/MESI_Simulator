This document explains how to run pin on programs to get trace output.
The pintool that has been edited for our use is ./source/tools/MemTrace/memtrace.cpp

Building:
cd ./source/tools/MemTrace/
make

Notes:
1. Always build again if memtrace.cpp is edited
2. Makefile parameters can be edited in ./source/tools/Config/makefile.unix.config

Running the pintool:
cd ./source/tools/MemTrace
../../../pin -t obj-intel64/memtrace.so -emit 1 -- ./programs/<your_program> -options

There should now be outputs in the MemTrace directory with .0, .1, .2, etc.
0 is the main thread, and 1+ are for the pthreads that were generated.
The pthread traces are probably the best to use for our simulator.
