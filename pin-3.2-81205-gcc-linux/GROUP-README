README for running the memtrace pintool
Author: Stephen Weston
Last Updated: 2/18/2017

This document explains how to run pin on programs to get trace output.
The pintool that has been edited for our use is ./source/tools/MemTrace/memtrace.cpp

Building:
cd ./source/tools/MemTrace/
make

Notes about building:
1. Always build again if memtrace.cpp is edited
2. Makefile parameters can be edited in ./source/tools/Config/makefile.unix.config

Running the pintool:
cd ./source/tools/MemTrace
../../../pin -t obj-intel64/memtrace.so -emit 1 -- ./programs/<your_program> -options

There are three programs in ./source/tools/MemTrace/programs/:
1. The tutorial program "sum" from HW2
2. The homework 2 pi calculation program that I wrote
3. The homework 3 heat map program that I wrote

Once pin is finished running, there should be outputs in the MemTrace directory with .0, .1, .2, etc. in their file extensions
0 is the main thread, and 1+ are for the pthreads that were generated.
The pthread traces are probably the best to use for our simulator.
